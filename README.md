Hello World!! (I never get sick of that by the way.)

I'm majoring in Web Design and Development at South Mountain Community College. I will be graduating this coming May, and I want to share and grow in my knowledge with other developers and employers. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting the hang of GitHub and understanding Version Control Systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently freshening up on HTML and CSS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Front-end projects or anything that seems interesting.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with staying consistent and managing time.
